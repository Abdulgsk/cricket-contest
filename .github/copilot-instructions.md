# GitHub Copilot Instructions — Cricket Contest

## What this app is

A private fantasy cricket league management app for **13 friends**. Members play Dream11 / My11Circle externally; this app tracks everything around it: scoring, bonuses, penalties, predictions, rivalries, Civil War team battles, leaderboards, contests view of live my11 teams, analytics, AI-generated daily storylines, and full admin tooling.

## ⚠️ Stack notes that contradict training data

- **Next.js 16.2.6** with App Router + Turbopack. APIs differ from older versions. If unsure, read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing code.
- **Middleware is `proxy.ts`** at the repo root (was `middleware.ts` in 15.x). Export is `proxy()`, not `middleware()`.
- **Tailwind v4** — no `tailwind.config.js`. Theme is defined in `app/globals.css`.
- **React 19** — server components are the default; mark client components with `"use client"`.
- **Mongoose 9** — connection cached in `lib/db.ts`.
- **Plain-text passwords** stored in `User.password` (explicit league policy — do NOT add bcrypt without being asked).
- **Single dynamic param syntax**: `params: Promise<{ id: string }>` then `await params`.

## File-layout overview

  (auth)/       login, signup, forgot-password
  (app)/        protected shell (dashboard, leaderboard, matches, predictions,
                profile, rules, analytics, contests, rivalry, players, admin)
  api/          REST endpoints (admin tools, contests, civil-war live,
                cron, players)
actions/        Server Actions ("use server") — only entry point for mutations
services/       Domain logic: scoring, prediction-engine, facts, civil-war,
                contest, ipl-sync, match-status, facts-ai, facts-analyzer,

                Rivalry, CivilWar, CustomPool, BonusAuditLog,

## Hard rules

1. **Never put scoring logic on the client.** All point math lives in `services/scoring.ts`, `services/prediction-engine.ts`, `services/civil-war.ts`.
2. **Mutations go through `actions/*.ts`** (Server Actions). API routes are for reads, external integrations (my11, cron) and admin tools.
3. **Auth & RBAC via `lib/rbac.ts`** — `requireUser()`, `requireRole("admin", "superadmin")`, `requireAdminFeature(featureKey)`. Features are in `lib/features.ts`.
4. **Mongo connection** — every entry point that touches the DB must `await connectDB()` from `lib/db.ts`.
5. **My11 calls** — go through `lib/my11-api.ts`. Live data; never DB-cached in a way that breaks freshness. Throws `My11AuthError`, `My11NotReadyError` — handle them.
6. **Scoring constants** live in `lib/constants.ts` (`RANK_POINTS`, `BONUSES`, `PENALTIES`, `PREDICTION_POINTS`, `MAX_BONUS_PER_MATCH`, `TOTAL_PLAYERS=13`). Don't hardcode numbers elsewhere.
7. **Single source of truth = `User.my11circleName`**. Denormalised copies (e.g. `UserMatchTeam.my11Username`) are kept in sync by the action that writes the name. Never read from copies as authoritative.
8. **Anti-hallucination AI** — every number in an AI fact must exist in the verified payload. See `services/facts-ai.ts::validateFacts`.
9. **Don't bypass admin approval flows** — my11 name changes, rivalry withdrawals, prediction resets all have explicit admin queues.
10. **No emojis in code unless they already exist in surrounding context** (UI uses some). Don't sprinkle them.

## Build / dev commands

```bash
npm run dev              # next dev (+ mini-browser auto-spawn in some envs)
npm run build            # next build (Turbopack); always run before pushing
npm run lint             # eslint
npm run start            # production start
```

Maintenance scripts (one-off): `npm run audit:history:points`, `fix:history:points:{dry,apply}`, `backfill:consistency:{dry,apply}`.
